# structure Comparison

## OLDserver (Traditional Structure)
- Simple structure with Database, middleware, models, and router folders
- Direct database interactions within middleware functions
- Monolithic design with less separation of concerns


## server (Hexagonal Architecture)
More modular with clear separation between:
- domain: Core business logic
- handler: API endpoints
- infra: Infrastructure concerns (database connection)
- models: Database models and queries
- persistent: Database interaction layer
- Services: Business logic services



## To run the updated docker app
docker-compose up --build


# Mock Unit Test Cases
## Comprehensive Mocking in Your Implementation
## Your mock implementation is comprehensive and covers:

1. Database Operations (mock_db.go)
- Mocks SQL queries, rows, results
- Simulates results for QueryRow, Exec, etc.
- Handles transactions with Begin, Commit, Rollback
2. Model Operations (mock_models.go)
- User operations: CreateUser, GetUserByUsername, etc.
- Todo operations: GetTodos, CreateTodo, etc.
- Team operations: CreateTeam, GetTeams, etc.
- Shared Todo operations: ShareTodoWithUser, etc.
- Routine operations: GetDailyRoutines, etc.
3. Middleware (mock_middleware.go)
- Authentication: AuthMiddleware
- JWT handling: GenerateJWT, ParseJWT
- HTTP handling: MockResponseWriter
